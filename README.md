# Bookmarks

A command-line program to create and open bookmarks.

# At a Bigger scope

You can think of it as browser bookmarks where folders are lists and sites are URLs or files in the system or executables

# Features

- create/remove/edit lists
- create/remove/edit/open items
- stores everything in a json file `lists.json`
- a backup `lists_backup.json` file contains the last state of the `lists.json` in case you fudged up

### Usage

1. Install the package:

```bash
$ npm i bookmarks-cli
```

2. Run the command `bookmarks-cli`:

```bash
$ bookmarks
```

From there it's pretty simple to use the cli tool.
